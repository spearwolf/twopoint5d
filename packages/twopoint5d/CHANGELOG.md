## [0.13.0] - Unreleased

> [!CAUTION]
> This version breaks with many things and clearly moves towards the use of WebGL2 and WebGPU!
>
> This follows the three.js library, which currently comes in two variants:
> `import THREE from 'three'` _vs._ `import THREE from 'three/webgpu'`
>
> Starting with version `0.13`, `twopoint5d` is freeing itself from legacy issues and moving completely to the `three/webgpu` side!
>
> The new _node materials_ and the _three shader language_ are exactly what was envisioned when `twopoint5d` was created.
> Instead of getting lost in custom workarounds that use the old materials and shaders, we have now switched exclusively and consistently to _tsl_.

- only use the `three/webgpu` package as import
- upgrade to three.js r178
- refactor `Display` &rarr; `resize`, `renderFrame` events
  - add types, constants and interfaces for `OnDisplayResize` and `OnDisplayRenderFrame`
  - _MIGRATION NOTE:_ the `frame` event has been renamed to `renderFrame`
  - add new helpers:
    - `display.onResize(callback)`
    - `display.onRenderFrame(callback)`
    - `display.onInit(callback)`
    - `display.onStart(callback)`
    - `display.onPause(callback)`
    - `display.onRestart(callback)`
    - `display.onDispose(callback)`
- the types and constants from `/events.js` are now also included in the main module
  - _MIGRATION NOTE:_ the import of `@spearwolf/twopoint5d/events.js` is now deprecated and should no longer be used. Just use `@spearwolf/twopoint5d` instead.
- _MIGRATION NOTE:_ renamed `DisplayEventArgs` to `DisplayEventProps`
- _MIGRATION NOTE:_ dropped `OnResizeProps` and `OnRenderFrameProps`. the only truth is `DisplayEventProps`
- add new constants and types: `OnDisplayInit`, `OnDisplayStart`, `OntDisplayRestart`, `OnDisplayPause` and `OnDisplayDispose`


## [0.12.0] - 2025-05-10

- refactor `IStage`, `PostProcessingRenderer`, add `Stage2DRenderPass`

&mldr;

## [0.11.0] - 2025-04-26

- remove auto creation of `WebGPURenderer` in `Display` when using `webgpu: true`
  - to avoid confusion with `three`and `three/webgpu` imports when using resolve aliases
  - you can still pass `renderer: new WebGPURenderer()` to the `Display` constructor (no need to pass `webgpu: true` in this case)
- convert last `three/examples/jsm` import to `three/addons`
- deactivate some hook tests in twopoint5d-r3f
  - time to ditch react-three-fiber support
    - the maintainance cost is too high

## [0.9.3] - 2025-03-26
